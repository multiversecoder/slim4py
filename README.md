Check on the official site: [http://slim-lang.com/](http://slim-lang.com/)

What is slim4py?
----------------

Slim4Py is a simple script that allows you to use all the functions of Slim (Ruby)
in any python framework with the addition that you can also use the
mako syntax (a popular and fast template engine for python).

Here is a small example of usage:

```python
from slim4py.slim import Slim

slim = Slim("slim")

def say_hello():
    return "Hello World"

slim.render("example.slim", say_hello=say_hello, year="2019", author="https://github.com/multiversecoder/slim4py")
```

About Magic Comments
--------------------

If you need to use python inside the templates, you can define at the beginning of the file a magic comment containing all the variables that will be rendered by mako using the logic written in python.

To define a magic comment use:

    / mako_vars = [name_var_1, name_var_2, ...]

This comment will be detected by the engine and rendered using mako and python.


Combining Python With Ruby
--------------------------

``` slim
/ mako_vars = [list_]
doctype 5

            its two or three
        % elif a.startswith("f"):
            four/five
        % else:
